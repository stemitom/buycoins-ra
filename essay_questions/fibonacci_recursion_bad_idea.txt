Using recursion to find the fibonacci sequence of a number causes multiple redundant calls(overlapping)
by recomputing same values over and over again.

fib(10) = fib(9) + fib(8)
fib(9) = fib(8) + fib(7)
fib(8) = fib(7) + fib(6)

Using this method, fib(5) will make 15 calls, fib(10) will make 177 calls and 
fibonacci(20) will make 20,000 calls.

This can be overcome by using Memoization or by using iterative method to calculate the fibonacci of a number.
